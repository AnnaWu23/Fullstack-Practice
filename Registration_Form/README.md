## Areas for Improvement

1. **Responsive Design**

   - Current form width is fixed at 35%, which doesn't work well on different devices
   - Need to add media queries for mobile device optimization

2. **Form Validation**

   - Currently only using basic HTML5 validation
   - Could add more robust client-side validation
   - Could add password strength checker
   - Could add real-time input validation feedback

3. **User Experience**

   - Could add loading state indicators
   - Could add form submission success/failure notifications
   - Could enhance input field focus state visual feedback

4. **Feature Extensions**

   - Could add local storage for form data
   - Could add form reset functionality
   - Could add remember user information feature

5. **Code Optimization**
   - Could add CSS variables for unified color and size management
   - Could optimize CSS selectors to reduce code duplication
   - Could add more detailed code comments

## How to Run
