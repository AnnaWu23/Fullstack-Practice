## Project Learnings

Through this project, I learned:

- HTML form element implementation
- CSS styling techniques for forms
- Form validation methods
- User experience considerations
- Form accessibility best practices
- Responsive form design principles

## Areas for Improvement

1. **Responsive Design**

   - Could add form submission success/failure notifications
   - Could enhance input field focus state visual feedback
   - Could add form reset functionality

4. **Feature Extensions**

   - Could add local storage for form data

   - Could add form data export functionality
   - Could add multi-step form wizard

5. **Code Optimization**
   - Could add CSS variables for unified color and size management
