# JavaScript Shopping List Project

[English](README.md) | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Project Overview

This is a shopping list management project built with JavaScript. The project demonstrates the application of fundamental JavaScript concepts, including data types, array operations, conditional statements, loops, functions, and objects. Through this project, we have implemented a simple yet functional shopping list management system.

## Project Background

Shopping list management is a common daily requirement. This project implements basic shopping list functionality using JavaScript, including adding items, removing items, and checking cart status. This project is suitable for JavaScript beginners to practice basic concepts.

### Core Features

- Shopping list creation and management
- Item addition and removal
- Cart capacity checking
- Item search functionality
- Item information object storage

### JavaScript Basic Concepts Application

- Array operations (push, pop, includes)
- Conditional statements (if-else)
- Loop statements (for)
- Function definition and calling
- Object creation and property access

### Code Structure

- Modular functionality implementation
- Clear code comments
- Logical function division
- Reusable function design

## Implementation Highlights

1. **Array Operations**

   - Using push method to add items
   - Using pop method to remove items
   - Using includes method to check item existence

2. **Function Design**

   - Cart capacity check function
   - Item list printing function
   - Item existence check function

3. **Object Application**

   - Item information objectification
   - Dynamic property addition
   - Object property access

4. **Code Optimization**
   - Function reuse
   - Clear variable naming
   - Appropriate code comments

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `ShoppingList.js` using Node.js
3. View the output in the console

## Project Learnings

Through this project, I learned:

- Basic JavaScript array operations
- Practical application of conditional and loop statements
- Best practices in function definition and calling
- Object creation and property manipulation
- Code modularization and reuse
- Console output and debugging techniques
- JavaScript basic syntax standards
- Importance of code readability and maintainability

## Future Improvement Directions

- Add user interface
- Implement data persistence
- Add more item management features
- Optimize code structure
- Add unit tests
