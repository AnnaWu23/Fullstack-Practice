// Task1: Let, Const å’Œ Var
// Description: Rewrite the following code to use let and const instead of var. Explain why let or const is more appropriate in each case.

// Case with using var
// In this case, var is used, and the name variable is overridden in the if block. It's global scope.
var nameVar = 'Alice'
if (true) {
    var nameVar = 'Bob'
    console.log(nameVar) // Bob
}
console.log(nameVar) // Bob

// Replace with let
// In this case, let is more appropriate because it has block scope, which means that the variable is only accessible within the block of code where it is declared.
// It won't override the Alice variable in the global scope.

let nameLet = 'Alice'
if (true) {
    let nameLet = 'Bob'
    console.log(nameLet) // Bob
}
console.log(nameLet) // Alice

// Replace with const
// In this case, const is more appropriate because it has block scope, which means that the variable is only accessible within the block of code where it is declared.
// It won't override the Alice variable in the global scope.
// const also provides immutability, which means that the value of the variable cannot be changed.

const nameConst = 'Alice'
if (true) {
    const nameConst = 'Bob'
    console.log(nameConst) // Bob
}
console.log(nameConst) // Alice

// Task2: Arrow Functions
// Description: Convert the following function to an arrow function. Then explain how arrow functions differ from regular functions in how they handle the this keyword.

// Regular function
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b
}

// Arrow function
// Arrow functions do not have this keyword, which means their this context is determined by the parent scope.
const addArrow = (a, b) => a + b

// Task3: Template Literals
// Description: Rewrite the following string concatenation code using template literals. Add a new line in the string.

// Regular string concatenation
let greeting = 'Hello, ' + nameLet + '! Welcome to the website.'

// Template literals
greeting = `Hello, ${nameLet}! 
Welcome to the website.`
console.log(greeting)

// Task4: Destructuring
// Description: Use destructuring to extract the name and age properties from the person object. Then write a function that destructures the properties of an object in the parameter list.

// Destructuring
const person = {
    name: 'Alice',
    age: 25,
    city: 'Sydney'
}

// Destructuring
const { name, age } = person
