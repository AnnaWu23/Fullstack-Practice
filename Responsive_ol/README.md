# Responsive Ordered List Project

[English](README.md) | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Project Overview

This is a responsive ordered list project built with HTML5 and CSS3. The project showcases some powerful but less commonly used CSS features, including CSS variables, counters, pseudo-elements, and gradients.

## Technical Features

### CSS Variables (Custom Properties)

- Using `:root` to define global CSS variables
- Defining custom properties with `--` prefix
- Referencing variables using `var()` function
- Variable scoping and inheritance features

### Counters

- Using `counter-reset` to initialize counters
- Using `counter-increment` to increment counts
- Displaying counts with `counter()` function
- Applying counters in pseudo-elements

### Pseudo-elements

- Application of `::before` pseudo-element
- Creating progress bars with pseudo-elements
- Creating numbered circles with pseudo-elements
- Positioning and styling pseudo-elements

### Gradients

- Creating linear gradients with `linear-gradient`
- Dynamic calculation of gradient stop points
- Controlling gradient colors with CSS variables
- Responsive gradient effects

### Responsive Design

- Implementing responsive layout with `@media` queries
- Style adjustments based on viewport width
- Layout optimization for mobile and desktop

## Implementation Highlights

1. **Dynamic Color Calculation**

   - Using HSL color mode
   - Dynamic hue calculation based on list item index
   - Controlling lightness and saturation through CSS variables

2. **Progress Bar Effect**

   - Creating progress bars with pseudo-elements
   - Dynamic calculation of progress bar length
   - Smooth gradient transition effects

3. **Numbered Circle Design**

   - Creating numbered circles with pseudo-elements
   - Automatic numbering with counters
   - Responsive size adjustments

4. **Layout Optimization**

   - Using `box-sizing: border-box`
   - Flexible spacing and margin settings
   - Centered list items

## Learning Points

1. **CSS Variable System**

   - Understanding CSS variable scoping
   - Mastering variable definition and usage
   - Learning variable applications in responsive design

2. **Counter Mechanism**

   - Understanding CSS counter principles
   - Mastering counter initialization and usage
   - Learning counter applications in complex layouts

3. **Pseudo-element Techniques**

   - Deep understanding of pseudo-element concepts
   - Mastering pseudo-element positioning
   - Learning to create decorative elements with pseudo-elements

4. **Responsive Design Principles**

   - Understanding media query use cases
   - Mastering responsive layout implementation
   - Learning mobile-first design principles

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. Adjust browser window size to observe responsive effects
